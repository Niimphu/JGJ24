# Avarice

This is a game made by myself and three others for [Yogscast's Jingle Game Jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/jinglegamejam2024). The game was created in Godot 4.3, and the downloaded source code can be viewed in-engine.

The game can be played on its [itch.io page](https://nimphu.itch.io/avarice).

# Theme

The theme of the jam was "Everything Has A Cost".

One of the first ideas I had was a dungeon crawler game where there would be a monetary cost for basic actions that a player might normally take for granted, such as a minimap, moving between floors, or opening chests.
In the end, the idea that everything would cost money persisted, but the gameplay transitioned to more of a rogue-lite shooter.

Here are some clips of when the game was in development:
